// Inheritance (in Javascript): One object gets access to the properties
// and methods of another object

// Classical Inheritance: The way inheritance is implemented in C++, Java, etc
// Its very verbose, involves lot of concepts and keywords like: friend, protected, private, interface

// Prototypal Inheritance: It is simple, flexible, extensible, easy to understand
