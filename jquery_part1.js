// jQuery doesnt add any extra feature to the browser or Javascript, it handles the browser's quirks.
// It lets you manipulate the DOM inside a browser. Its separate from Javascript engine. It looks at
// html and decides how to render it on screen. A tree like structure that stores a representation
// of the html. jQuery makes it easy to look at DOM to find elements on page and manipulate them.
